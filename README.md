# Student Portal

All your needs as a student just a click away.

Student life, often mentioned as the "seed time" of life is undoubtedly the most important time for any person to build their life. Success of a person depends on how well s/he utilizes the time. And without a doubt, student life is the best time for it. To make the life of a student a bit more easy, we made 'Student Portal', a simple yet useful app to help the student push their limit a bit more further. 

This app is bundled with 8 different modules with their own use cases starting from a simple To Do list to a wikipedia integration. And everything is tied together with simple intuitive layout for an easy workflow. 

## Installation

We provided with 2 ways to install the app. 

- Install the executable from the releases
- Run the script

We recommend using the executable file if you don't have python properly installed in your machine.

However, if you want to run the scripts, then you must have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) properly installed in your machine. Then use these 5 simple commands to run the app.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FirePlank/Student-Portal.git # it clones the repository in your machine

cd Student-Portal # Change your working directory

pip install -r requirements.txt # Install all the dependencies, might take time depending on your internet speed

cd app # Again change the directory

python main.py # Run the app
```

Now enjoy the app üòâ. 

Here is a simple gif on how to install it if you are still confused.
